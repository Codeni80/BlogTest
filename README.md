This is a blogtest I created using the peewee blog tutorial, it is for testing purposes only and was only uploaded to git to show a friend how it worked/to play with.

Currently to login/use the blog you must manually go to the login page (localhost:5000/login). 
After logging in you can use the site as an administrator.
